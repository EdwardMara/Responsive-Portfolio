<h1>Responsive-Portfolio</h1>

This assignment involves updating the style sheet of my portfolio page in order to make it responsive to the size of the viewport.

Responsiveness is important because it allows users to view the page's content in a way that is compatible with the users' screen.  This reduces unnecessary scrolling and zooming by reformatting the in ways that are dependent on screen width thresholds.

980px, 768px, and 640px are the widths I defined for the three most common view sizes.
980px being for computer monitors down to 640 which is common for mobile devices.

Chrome inspect tools and extensions for explicitly defining browser window size were helpful in testing different sized screen output on my workstation.
